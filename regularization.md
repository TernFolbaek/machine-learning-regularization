# Regularization 
Regularization is a technique used within machine learning which is often used when a model is at risk of overfitting the data. Overfitting happens when the model learns too much from the training data and begins steering towards minor details, capturing noise and minor fluctuations.

The way regularization works is by modifying our cost function, which is what our model is trying to minimize the value of. The higher the cost function the further off the model is of predicting the correct answers for our training data. 

## Cost functions with regularization
### Cost function for regularized linear regression

The equation for the cost function regularized linear regression is:
$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2  + \frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2 \tag{1}$$ 
where:
$$f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b  \tag{2}$$ 


Compare this to the cost function without regularization (which you implemented in  a previous lab), which is of the form:

$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $$ 

The difference is the regularization term,  <span>
    $\frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2$ </span> 
    
Including this term encourages gradient descent to minimize the size of the parameters. Note, in this example, the parameter $b$ is not regularized. This is standard practice.

Below is an implementation of equations (1) and (2). Note that this uses a *standard pattern for this course*,   a `for loop` over all `m` examples.

### Cost function for regularized logistic regression
For regularized **logistic** regression, the cost function is of the form
$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{m}  \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left[ -y^{(i)} \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - y^{(i)}\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2 \tag{3}$$
where:
$$f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = sigmoid(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b)  \tag{4}$$ 

Compare this to the cost function without regularization (which you implemented in  a previous lab):

$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left[ (-y^{(i)} \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - y^{(i)}\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right)\right]$$

As was the case in linear regression above, the difference is the regularization term, which is    <span >
    $\frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2$ </span> 

Including this term encourages gradient descent to minimize the size of the parameters. Note, in this example, the parameter $b$ is not regularized. This is standard practice. 

## Gradient descent with regularization

The basic algorithm for running gradient descent does not change with regularization, it is:

$$
\text{Repeat until convergence:} \\
\begin{aligned}
w_j &= w_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j} \quad \text{for } j = 0, \dots, n-1 \\
b &= b - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where each iteration performs simultaneous updates on $w_j$ for all $j$.




What changes with regularization is computing the gradients.

### Computing the Gradient with regularization (both linear/logistic)

The gradient calculation for both linear and logistic regression are nearly identical, differing only in the computation of $f_{\mathbf{w},b}$.

$\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left( f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) x_j^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{m} w_j \tag{2}$

$\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left( f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) \tag{3}$



* m is the number of training examples in the data set      
* $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction, while $y^{(i)}$ is the target

      
* For a  <span > **linear** </span> regression model  
    $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b$  
* For a <span > **logistic** </span> regression model  
    $z = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b$  
    $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x) = g(z)$  
    where $g(z)$ is the sigmoid function:  
    $g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$   
    
The term which adds regularization is  the <span >$\frac{\lambda}{m} w_j $</span>.
